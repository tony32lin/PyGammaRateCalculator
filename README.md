# Introduction
Calculate expected gamma-ray rate using EventDisplay Instrument Response Function.
This pacakge uses PyROOT to access EventDisplay functions. At the moment, I've only 
tested this using ED480a with ROOT v5.34. 

# Requirement
You'll need PyROOT and EventDisplay installed to use this pacakge. On the python side, 
numpy and click are also required.
